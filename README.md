# Tic-Tac-Toc
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C language. The game allows two players to play against each other on a text-based interface.

## Features
1. Two-player gameplay: Players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid.
2. Basic input validation: Invalid moves (e.g., placing a mark outside the board or on an already occupied position) are detected and handled.
3. Winner determination: The game automatically detects if there's a winner or if the game ends in a draw.
4. User-friendly interface: The game displays the current state of the board after each move and provides clear instructions to the players.
## Getting Started
1. Compile the source code (Tic-Tac-Toe.c)using a C compiler such as GCC.
2. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns and play the game.
## Acknowledgments
  This Tic-Tac-Toe game was created as a learning exercise in C programming. Feel free to modify and improve it as needed.
